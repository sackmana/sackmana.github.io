I am an evolutionary geneticist working as a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Biology at Washington and Lee University.

I study the genetics of adaptation with a focus on the mechanisms by which epistasis, pleiotropy, and the underlying distribution of fitness effects (DFE) determine the properties of adaptive walks. My work utilizes a combination of wet-lab and computational approaches. In the lab, I experimentally evolve microvirid bacteriophages to explore the properties and limits of adaptation. I also work toward the development of new population genetic methods that are applicable to viruses and other organisms with highly skewed offspring distributions, for the purpose of analyzing population genomic data from experimentally evolved populations.
