### Exercise 1

You are a level 4 dwarf cleric named Edmund Strongjaw. You are engaged in a battle with an orc fighter. The orc has an armor class of 14, meaning that it takes an attack roll of 14 or better to land an attack with your battle axe. 


1) What is the probability that you successfully hit the orc on your next attack roll with a 20-sided die with sides labeled 1 through 20? Express your answer in probability notation.\
\
\

2) What if you had a magical axe that added two points to your attack roll (meaning that your maximum roll value is now a 22 and your minimum roll is a 3, or, in other words, you need to roll a 12 or higher)?\
\

3) What is the probability that you successfully land three attacks in a row, when you need a 12 or higher?\
\
\

4) Suppose you have "advantage" on your roll, meaning that you get to roll the die twice and take the better of the two rolls. Now what is the likelihood of a successfull attack, assuming that you still just need a 12 or better?\
